	<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Eno is a tool that generates survey questionnaires starting from their formal description, i.e. from metadata describing the questionnaire. Eno is used by Insee since 2015, to produce web questionnaires for business surveys, from their description in <a href="http://ddialliance.org/">DDI</a> 3.2. Nearly 15 surveys are already using Eno for their web questionnaires.</p>
	<p>Due to its modular design, Eno can create questionnaires in different formats from the same DDI description. Currently, Eno generates XForms web questionnaires that can be executed on <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/">Orbeon Forms Runner</a>. PDF questionnaires is under development.</p>

	<h2>Eno produces survey questionnaires</h2>

	<p>The use of standard description in DDI provides structured information and consequently well structured questionnaire.</p>
	<p>DDI description enables to identify clearly the different components of a questionnaire, such as sequences of questions, questions, instructions, different formats of response.</p>
	<p>Common used response formats are available : simple text, number, date, single choice question, multiple choice question, grid question.</p>
	<p>This type of questionnaire also allows us to incorporate dynamic layout : filters and questionnaire logic flow, loops, controls to check the format of the input fields, consistency between the different input fields and, where necessary, with previous collected data. Controls are emphasized by probing messages to invite respondent to correct or fulfill his response.</p>
	<p>Labels can be customized with informations on the respondent, already known before data collection (from a register eg), as well as collected previously in the form. </p>
	<p>Forms can be pre-filled with previously collected data as well.</p>
	<p>The distinction between questionnaire's elements allows to show them in different ways and styles, and to create a coherent layout for questionnaires produced.</p>
	<p>Eno is developped in an international perspective, codes and comments are in english. Data can be collected in any langage.</p>

	<h1>Objectives: standardization, industrialization, reuse</h1>

	<h2>Eno is a generator and meets the need of standardisation and industrialisation</h2>

	<p>The development of one tool, based on standardised description in DDI leads to a standardized design. It ensures that questionnaires comply with standards and recommendations on survey design.</p>
	<p>Display choices are shared between surveys within the NSI, improvements are available/profitable for every users at the same time.</p>
	<p>Using a generator lightens the burden of work for the survey departments.</p>
	<p>The generation of different data collection formats from the same questionnaire description supports unimode design for mixed mode surveys.</p>
	<p>The questionnaire documentation can be stored and reused, in a global NSI context, or for a similar survey from year to year. Classifications are shared between different surveys teams.</p>
	<p>Eno is a stakeholder in active metadata: the questionnaire description can be reused for dissemination or documentation of surveys.</p>

	<h1>How to get it?</h1>

	<p>Eno is published as open source on a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/InseeFr/Eno">repository</a>. It is available under the MIT license, and contributions as well as suggestions for improvements are welcome.</p>

	<h1><p>How to use it?</h1>

	<p>Eno comes packaged in various ways: as a command-line tool, a REST web service and a Docker image.</p>

	<h2>Roadmap</h2>

	<p>Eno was built, tested and run on business surveys only at the moment. Future work will allow to perform significantly more surveys by providing new output formats for Eno (paper very soon) and a bigger functional coverage for household surveys (for example: more complex logic flows that can be found in household surveys).</p>
